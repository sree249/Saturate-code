# Saturate code - an application for optimization problems linked with social network analysis

## Brief description and purpose
Implementation of saturate code and optimization routines
A foundational and exhaustive code bank, include various network related optimization routines that can be used for a dimension of combinatorial optimization problems, using social network as an application case. 
Several different optimization routines are combined with computational scale-up methods that might help to run these optimization related programs more smoothly. 

I hope this can help those who wish to implement these algorithmic routines/adapt it for their own experiments.
